      <h2>Virtual Reality-A New World</h2>
      <p>VR is the computer-generated simulation of a 3D image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. <br> <br>
      If you choose to try VR, you are leaving the real world and immerse yourself into new one. Your visual and hearing sensors are focused into the artificial world. Your actions, flailing around with your hands, jumping up and down has an effect on the VR world (and the real one as well). </p>

      <h2>Applications Of Virtual Reality</h2>
       <b>Education:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>We all know that our world is based on the use of vocational skills on a daily basis, but how do we use VR to enable students to practice this type of content?</li> <br>
          
          <li>Well, one of the greatest benefits of VR being integrated into classroom-based learning, is how it allows for students to be trained from realistic scenarios, which VR can stimulate.</li> <br>
          
          <li>An experiment conducted by Google’s Daydream Labs revealed that students who received <b>VR training learned in a more efficient way </b>than those who used classroom/video-based tutorials.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Computer-Generated Architecture:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past, architectures had to settle for constructing models of buildings or designs out of resources they already had (real-world materials), but thanks to VR technology, they can now build <b>computer-generated models </b>that can be explored interactively.</li> <br>
            
            <li>The Oculus Rift hardware allows for eager students to construct different buildings and implement them into 3D models to bring their plans to life, even to explore them virtually.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Companies Disrupting AR and VR</h2> 
       <p>Let’s take a closer look at the companies making immense progress in the space of virtual and augmented reality.

      <b>Microsoft-HoloLens:</b>
      <ul>
          <li>Microsoft constructed a new virtual reality headset with transparent AR lenses called HoloLens, which is comparable to a holographic computer. This hardware injects interactive holograms into our natural environments and surrounds us with a full array of apps in an interactive experience.</li> <br>
          
          <li>Exploring the field of mixed reality (MR), the HoloLens applies features from both AR and VR, to give users a fully immersive experience, and features a wide field of view (FOV), and a transparent surface for AR applications.</li> <br>
      </ul>
      <br><div class="fakeimg"><img src="img/imgfour.png" alt=""></div>
      <p>As you can see, there really is no limit to this emerging technology, as the future of AR and VR applications will disrupt the fields of medicine, education and even how we live our every day lives.</p> <br>
      
      <p>The opportunities in these fields are endless and we can now physically be in experiences rather than watching them from the side-lines.</p>
